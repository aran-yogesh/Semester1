    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class named Dwarf.\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the following variables (attributes) within the class (they must be numeric and should be random):\n",
    "strength\n",
    "constitution (this is an obtuse way of saying how tough you are)\n",
    "agility\n",
    "charisma\n",
    "Enumerated Outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an enumeration named DwarfOutcome using the enum module. This enumeration should include the following values:\n",
    "ATTACK_HITS: Represents a successful attack.\n",
    "DODGE: Represents a dodged attack.\n",
    "DRUNK: Represents the dwarf feeling drunk.\n",
    "SOBER: Represents the dwarf holding their liquor.\n",
    "ATTRACTIVE: Represents the dwarf being perceived as attractive.\n",
    "NOT_IMPRESSIVE: Represents the dwarf not being perceived as attractive.\n",
    "UNCONSCIOUS: Represents the dwarf being knocked unconscious.\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the following methods, ensuring each method returns an enumerated value from the DwarfOutcome enumeration:\n",
    "\n",
    "fight:\n",

    "Simulate an attack using strength for the attack outcome and agilityfor defense.\n",
    "A dwarf with more strength should do better at attacking.\n",
    "A dwarf with more agility should do better at defending.\n",
    "These results should be somewhat random such that the same dwarves may have different outcomes over multiple trials.\n",
    "If the attack is unsuccessful, return DwarfOutcome.DODGE.\n",
    "If the attack is successful, check to see if the dwarf is unconscious. A dwarf with higher constitution should be harder to knock out.\n",
    "Return DwarfOutcome.ATTACK_HITS if the dwarf is hit but not unconscious. Return DwarfOutcome.UNCONSCIOUS if the dwarf is knocked out.\n",
    "drink:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use constitutionto determine the likelihood of becoming drunk, with likelihood increasing with each drink.\n",
    " A dwarf with more constitution should be drink more before feeling drunk.\n",
    "Return DwarfOutcome.DRUNK if the dwarf is feeling drunk; otherwise, return DwarfOutcome.SOBER.\n",
    "woo:\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempt to make another dwarf think this dwarf is attractive using the charisma attribute. Those with similar charisma are more likely to find each other attractive.\n",

    "**Fight Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fairness of Initial Dwarves**\n",
    "   - When two dwarves with equal probability (0.5) fight, outcomes should be nearly even.\n",
    "   - If wins fall outside the lower or upper bounds, the fight is deemed unfair.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strength and Agility Modifications**\n",
    "   - **Strength Increase**: First dwarf's strength increased by 20% (`dwarf.strength = int(dwarf.strength * 1.2)`).\n",
    "   - **Agility Decrease**: Opponent's agility decreased by 20% (`opponent.agility = int(opponent.agility * 0.8)`).\n",
    "   - Despite adjustments and a probability parameter of 0.8, fights should remain fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weak vs. Agile Dwarves**\n",
    "   - Testing a weakened dwarf (50% strength) against a more agile dwarf (200% agility).\n",
    "   - If the weaker dwarf wins too often, it indicates a balance issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drink Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Drink Limit**\n",
    "   - No more than 2% (max 20 out of 1,000) should pass out after one drink.\n",
    "   - Exceeding this suggests flaws in drinking mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two Drinks Limit**\n",
    "   - No more than 5% (max 50 out of 1,000) should pass out after two drinks.\n",
    "   - Exceeding this indicates issues with the drink logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Five Drinks Limit**\n",
    "   - No more than 50% (max 500 out of 1,000) should pass out after five drinks.\n",
    "   - Exceeding this suggests problems with drinking mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Twenty Drinks Limit**\n",
    "   - At least 10% (max 900 out of 1,000) should handle 20 drinks without passing out.\n",
    "   - If more than 900 pass out, the mechanic is too punitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Minimum Passed Out After Twenty Drinks**\n",
    "   - At least 20% (min 200 out of 1,000) should pass out after 20 drinks.\n",
    "   - Fewer than 200 indicates drinking mechanics are too lenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Constitution and Drinking Capacity**\n",
    "   - A dwarf with double the constitution shouldn't be out-drunk more than 10% of the time.\n",
    "   - If out-drunk more than 100 times out of 1,000, there's a significant imbalance.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Woo Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Minimum Success Rate**\n",
    "   - At least 5% (min 50 out of 1,000) should successfully woo each other.\n",
    "   - Fewer than 50 successes mean attractiveness mechanics are too strict.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maximum Success Rate**\n",
    "   - No more than 80% (max 800 out of 1,000) should successfully woo each other.\n",
    "   - More than 800 successes suggest dwarves are too easily attracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Charisma Equality**\n",
    "   - Dwarves with the same charisma should have a significant number of successful wooing attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Charisma Comparison**\n",
    "   - When one dwarf's charisma is double the other's:\n",
    "     - Successful wooing attempts should be substantially lower.\n",
    "     - Success with similar charisma should be at least 1.5 times higher than with differing charisma.\n",
    "   - If not, charisma isn't significantly affecting attractiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Minimum Successful Matches with Different Charisma**\n",
    "   - At least 100 successes when one dwarf has double the charisma.\n",
    "   - Fewer than 100 indicates insufficient variability due to charisma differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Maximum Success Rate with Similar Charisma**\n",
    "   - No more than 90% (max 900 out of 1,000) successes with similar charisma.\n",
    "   - More than 900 suggests dwarves lack discernment.\n",

    "**Overall Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimum Success Rate**: At least 50 successful wooing attempts out of 1,000.\n",
    "- **Maximum Success Rate**: No more than 800 successful attempts out of 1,000.\n",
    "- **Charisma Equality**: Equal charisma should lead to significantly higher success rates.\n",
    "- **Charisma Comparison Ratio**: Success with similar charisma should be at least 1.5 times that of differing charisma.\n",
    "- **Minimum Successes with Different Charisma**: At least 100 successful attempts.\n",
